                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My favorite pass time as a kid was solving puzzles, which included playing Sudoku, spending hours on jigsaw puzzles, 
                        and working on hard math problems at school. Those things might sound tedious to some (especially the last one), 
                        but they all encapsulate who I am today: a problem solver. At first, I thought I could put my passions to use by 
                        helping people and becoming a doctor, but the field did not meet my expectations and made me lose sight of my joy of 
                        problem-solving.</p>
                    <p>Teaching was another niche that I loved. I tutored students in high school, was a teaching assistant at university, 
                        and taught high schoolers a variety of subjects over the last year. This felt closer to my goal but still never achieved 
                        the level of fulfillment compared to the moment I wrote my first line of code with two little words: Hello, World.</p>
                    <p>Since then, I have spent countless hours on the side of my already busy life to learn more about coding and web development. 
                        After learning HTML and CSS, I have heard that many get discouraged by the load of new information in the webâ€™s main programming 
                        language: JavaScript. For me, that was the lightbulb moment that I viewed creating algorithms and finding bugs the same as solving 
                        puzzles as a kid. The web never ceases to amaze me with the endless number of challenges that are waiting to be solved.</p>
